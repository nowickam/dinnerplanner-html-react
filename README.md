# dinnerplanner-html-react

The program is a realization of the laboratory assignments for DH2642 Interaction Programming and Dynamic Web course at Kungliga Tekniska HÃ¶gskolan (Stockholm), done in collaboration with Saga Harnesk. This is a follow-up of the dinnerplanner-html project.

The work was aimed at learning a framework of our choice - here React. In terms of functionality of the program, it is supposed to mimick the behaviour of dinnerplanner-html app. The implementation is done with the use of JSX.
